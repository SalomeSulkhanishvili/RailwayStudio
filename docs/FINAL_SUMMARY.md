# Railway Editor - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Curved Rails = 30 Degrees**
- Each curved rail turns 30°
- 3 curved rails = 90° turn
- Connection points match 30° endpoints

### 2. **Rail Types**
- **Straight rails**
- **Curved rails** (30° angle)
- **Switch Left** (turnout with 30° diverging track)
- **Switch Right** (turnout with 30° diverging track)

### 3. **Drag-to-Connect Functionality**
- Drag red connection points together
- Auto-snap when within 30 pixels
- Rails automatically align perfectly
- Connection points turn green when connected
- Double-click to disconnect

### 4. **Auto-Snap Rails**
- When connecting, rails move to align perfectly
- Connection points match exactly
- No manual positioning needed

### 5. **Grouping Algorithm** ⭐
**ONLY splits at turnouts (switch_left/switch_right)**

#### Rules:
- ✅ No turnouts → All connected rails = **1 GROUP**
- ✅ Turnouts present → Rails split at turnouts = **Multiple GROUPS**
- ❌ Does NOT split based on:
  - Rail type (straight/curved)
  - Rail position
  - 90-degree turns
  - Number of rails

#### How It Works:
1. Finds all turnouts (switch_left, switch_right)
2. Traverses from each rail through connections
3. When hitting a turnout → stops (turnout is boundary)
4. All connected non-turnout rails = ONE group

### 6. **Block IDs Display**
- Shows block IDs (BL001001, BL002001, etc.) in gray
- Positioned above rails for visibility
- Follows rail when moving/rotating
- Auto-assigned when creating groups

### 7. **JSON Format - BlockGroups**

#### Structure:
```json
{
  "blockGroups": {
    "BG001": {
      "id": "BG001",
      "description": "Section 1",
      "blocks": [
        {
          "id": "BL001001",
          "axleCounter": "AC001001",
          "signals": [
            {"id": "SG001001_F", "direction": 0},
            {"id": "SG001001_B", "direction": 1}
          ],
          "grid_pos": [2, 5],
          "_original": {...}
        }
      ],
      "start_block_id": "BL001001",
      "end_block_id": "BL001003",
      "last_block_axleCounter": "AC001004"
    }
  },
  "turnouts": {
    "groups": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "_legacy_data": {...}
  }
}
```

### 8. **Auto-Generated IDs**
Every block gets:
- **Block ID**: BL{group}{number} (e.g., BL001001)
- **Axle Counter**: AC{group}{number} (e.g., AC001001)
- **Signals**: 
  - Forward: SG{group}{number}_F (direction: 0)
  - Backward: SG{group}{number}_B (direction: 1)

### 9. **Connection Restoration**
- Saves all connections in `_legacy_data`
- Restores connections when loading
- Recreates groups based on actual connections
- Preserves linked-list structure (next_rails, prev_rails)

### 10. **Monitor Mode**
- Load and display layouts
- Network listener (UDP port 5000)
- Update block colors in real-time
- JSON packet format support

## 🎯 Workflow

### Creating a Layout:
1. Open app → Editor Mode
2. Select rail type (Straight/Curved/Switch)
3. Click to place rails
4. Drag connection points to connect
5. Click "Auto-Create Groups" → Assigns IDs
6. Save → Exports blockGroups JSON

### Loading a Layout:
1. File → Open
2. Loads rails with positions
3. Restores connections
4. Recreates groups (only at turnouts!)
5. Shows block IDs on rails

### Monitoring:
1. Switch to Monitor Mode
2. Start network listener
3. Send packets: `{"block_id": "BL001001", "color": "red"}`
4. Block colors update in real-time

## 📋 Key Points

### Grouping (Most Important!):
- **ONLY turnouts create group boundaries**
- Connected straight/curved rails = 1 group
- Don't care about position, rotation, or rail count
- Only `switch_left` and `switch_right` split groups

### IDs:
- Block IDs assigned when auto-creating groups
- Visible in editor (gray text above rails)
- Saved in JSON blockGroups format
- Used for monitoring/tracking

### Connections:
- Red dots = unconnected
- Green dots = connected
- Drag to connect (30px threshold)
- Double-click to disconnect
- Auto-snap for perfect alignment

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Multiple groups but no turnouts"
**Problem**: Rails are disconnected
**Solution**: Connect all rails, or add turnout between sections

### "IDs not showing"
**Problem**: Haven't run auto-create groups
**Solution**: Click "Auto-Create Groups" button

### "Connections lost after loading"
**Problem**: Old JSON without _legacy_data
**Solution**: Resave the file with current version

### "Groups based on position"
**Problem**: Algorithm issue (FIXED)
**Solution**: Now only uses turnouts for boundaries
