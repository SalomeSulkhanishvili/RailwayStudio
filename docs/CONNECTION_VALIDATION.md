# Connection Validation - Next/Prev Structure

## Overview
The validation system now includes **comprehensive checks for next_rails and prev_rails** structure to ensure the railway system's linked-list integrity.

## What Was Added

### New Validation Checks:

#### 1. **Detailed Connection Info** 📋
When a block has no connections, error now shows:
```
❌ Block 'rail_0007' (straight) has NO connections!
   It is completely isolated.
   next_rails: [] (empty)
   prev_rails: [] (empty)
   → Action: Connect it to other rails or delete it.
```

#### 2. **Next/Prev Structure Check** 🔗
For blocks with multiple connections, validates proper structure:
```python
# Middle blocks should have both next and prev
if connections >= 2:
    has_next_in_group = check if block has next_rails
    has_prev_in_group = check if block has prev_rails
    
    if not has_next AND not has_prev:
        ERROR: "Broken next/prev structure!"
```

**Error Example:**
```
❌ Block 'rail_0004' (curved) has broken next/prev structure!
   Connected to 2 blocks but neither as next nor prev.
   next_rails: ['rail_0001']  ← Outside group
   prev_rails: ['rail_0009']  ← Outside group
   → This indicates a connection logic error.
   → Try disconnecting and reconnecting this block.
```

#### 3. **Bidirectional Consistency Check** ↔️
Validates that connections are properly mirrored:

**Rule 1: next_rails Consistency**
```python
if A.next_rails contains B:
    then B.prev_rails MUST contain A
```

**Rule 2: prev_rails Consistency**
```python
if A.prev_rails contains B:
    then B.next_rails MUST contain A
```

**Error Example:**
```
❌ Connection inconsistency: 'rail_0003' → 'rail_0005'
   'rail_0003' has 'rail_0005' in next_rails
   BUT 'rail_0005' does NOT have 'rail_0003' in prev_rails!
   → This is a data corruption issue.
   → Try disconnecting and reconnecting these blocks.
```

## Validation Hierarchy

### Level 1: Block Existence
```
Check: Does block exist in system?
✅ Pass: Block found
❌ Fail: Block missing (shouldn't happen in normal operation)
```

### Level 2: Group Membership
```
Check: Is block in a group?
✅ Pass: Block is grouped
❌ Fail: "Block is NOT in any group!"
```

### Level 3: Connection Existence
```
Check: Does block have any connections?
✅ Pass: Has next_rails OR prev_rails
❌ Fail: "Block has NO connections!"
       Shows: next_rails: []
              prev_rails: []
```

### Level 4: Group Connectivity
```
Check: Is block connected to its group members?
✅ Pass: Connected within group
❌ Fail: "Block NOT connected to any other block in group!"
```

### Level 5: Next/Prev Structure
```
Check: For middle blocks, proper next/prev usage?
✅ Pass: Has both next and prev within group
❌ Fail: "Broken next/prev structure!"
       Shows: next_rails: [...]
              prev_rails: [...]
```

### Level 6: Bidirectional Consistency
```
Check: Are connections properly mirrored?
✅ Pass: A→B implies B←A
❌ Fail: "Connection inconsistency!"
       Shows which direction is missing
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Isolated Block ❌
```
Layout:
[Rail A]━━[Rail B]━━[Rail C]
[Rail D]  ← Isolated

Validation Result:
❌ Block 'rail_0004' (straight) has NO connections!
   next_rails: [] (empty)
   prev_rails: [] (empty)
```

### Scenario 2: Broken Chain ❌
```
Layout:
[Rail A]━━[Rail B]   [Rail C]━━[Rail D]
          ↑ Missing connection

Validation Result:
❌ Block 'rail_0002' → 'rail_0003' inconsistency
   'rail_0002' has 'rail_0003' in next_rails
   BUT 'rail_0003' does NOT have 'rail_0002' in prev_rails!
```

### Scenario 3: Valid Linear Chain ✅
```
Layout:
[Rail A]━━[Rail B]━━[Rail C]━━[Rail D]

Structure:
Rail A: next=[B], prev=[]      ← Start
Rail B: next=[C], prev=[A]     ← Middle
Rail C: next=[D], prev=[B]     ← Middle  
Rail D: next=[], prev=[C]      ← End

Validation Result: ✅ All checks pass!
```

### Scenario 4: Valid Branch (with Turnout) ✅
```
Layout:
[Rail A]━━[Turnout]━━[Rail B]
              ╲
               ╲━━[Rail C]

Structure:
Rail A:    next=[Turnout], prev=[]
Turnout:   next=[B, C], prev=[A]     ← Switch
Rail B:    next=[], prev=[Turnout]
Rail C:    next=[], prev=[Turnout]

Validation Result: ✅ All checks pass!
(Turnouts excluded from groups)
```

### Scenario 5: Data Corruption ❌
```
Layout appears connected but data is corrupt:

Rail A claims: next=[B]
Rail B claims: prev=[C]  ← Should be prev=[A]

Validation Result:
❌ Connection inconsistency: 'rail_A' → 'rail_B'
   'rail_A' has 'rail_B' in next_rails
   BUT 'rail_B' does NOT have 'rail_A' in prev_rails!
```

## Connection Types Validated

### 1. **End-to-Start** (Normal Forward)
```
[Rail A]end → start[Rail B]

A.next_rails = [B]
B.prev_rails = [A]
✅ Validated bidirectionally
```

### 2. **Start-to-End** (Normal Reverse)
```
[Rail A]start ← end[Rail B]

A.prev_rails = [B]
B.next_rails = [A]
✅ Validated bidirectionally
```

### 3. **Start-to-Start** (Facing Away)
```
start[Rail A] ← → [Rail B]start

A.prev_rails = [B]
B.prev_rails = [A]
✅ Validated bidirectionally
```

### 4. **End-to-End** (Facing Together)
```
[Rail A]end → ← end[Rail B]

A.next_rails = [B]
B.next_rails = [A]
✅ Validated bidirectionally
```

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Code Structure:

```python
def _validate_groups(self):
    errors = []
    
    # 1. Check ungrouped blocks
    ungrouped = all_blocks - grouped_blocks
    if ungrouped:
        error("Blocks not in groups")
    
    # 2. Check each block in groups
    for group in groups:
        for block in group.blocks:
            # 2a. Check isolation
            if len(next_rails) + len(prev_rails) == 0:
                error("No connections", show next/prev)
            
            # 2b. Check structure
            elif multiple_connections:
                if not (has_next OR has_prev):
                    error("Broken structure", show next/prev)
            
            # 2c. Check group connectivity
            if not connected_to_group:
                error("Not connected to group")
    
    # 3. Check bidirectional consistency
    for block in all_blocks:
        for next_id in block.next_rails:
            if block_id not in next_block.prev_rails:
                error("Inconsistency: A→B but B↚A")
        
        for prev_id in block.prev_rails:
            if block_id not in prev_block.next_rails:
                error("Inconsistency: A←B but A↛B")
    
    if errors:
        raise ValueError(errors)
```

### When Validation Runs:

1. **Auto-Create Groups** → Full validation
2. **File → Save** → Full validation (blocks save if invalid)
3. **File → Load** → Full validation (shows errors on corrupt data)

## Benefits

✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures linked-list structure is correct
✅ **Corruption Detection**: Catches bidirectional inconsistencies
✅ **Clear Errors**: Shows next_rails and prev_rails in messages
✅ **Specific Issues**: Identifies exact connection problems
✅ **Actionable**: Tells you how to fix each type of error
✅ **Comprehensive**: Checks all connection types and structures

## Testing

### Test 1: Valid Linear Chain
```bash
1. Create 5 straight rails
2. Connect them in sequence (A→B→C→D→E)
3. Click "Auto-Create Groups"
   → ✅ SUCCESS!
   → Rails have proper next/prev structure
```

### Test 2: Isolated Block
```bash
1. Create 3 rails
2. Connect 2, leave 1 isolated
3. Click "Auto-Create Groups" or Save
   → ❌ ERROR: Shows next_rails and prev_rails (both empty)
4. Connect the isolated rail
5. Try again → ✅ SUCCESS!
```

### Test 3: Broken Connection (Manual Test)
```bash
This would require corrupting data manually,
which shouldn't happen in normal operation.
But if it does, validation catches it!
```

### Test 4: Complex Layout with Turnouts
```bash
1. Create layout with switches
2. Connect rails through turnouts
3. Click "Auto-Create Groups"
   → ✅ SUCCESS!
   → Turnouts properly link groups
   → Each group validated separately
```
